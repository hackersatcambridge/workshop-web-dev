  A guide for someone who has never met you or seen this workshop before on how to present this workshop

  Optional - Create a presenter guide only when content exists that can't be gleaned from other files
 -->

Watch the video recordings (when they're up) to get the best idea of how the content is intended to be delivered. It has been constructed to be given over three individual workshops. Roughly:

- Workshop 1: Sections 1 and 2
- Workshop 2: Section 3
- Workshop 3: Sections 4 and 5

This workshop works well when run with a competition for best website at the end. Mention this to attendees when you start (and keep reminding them at every session).

## Practical Sections and Demonstrators

The purpose of this workshop is to spend as much time in the practical sessions, with questions being asked directly to demonstrators. Demonstrators should distribute themselves in the room, introducing themselves to people as they come in.

If someone is lost, try to ground them in the notes. Find out the last section they completed successfully, direct them back there, and find out what tripped them up.

If someone is speeding ahead, let them do so! The tasks marked "challenge" are there to slow them down, but if even that is proving easy, try to dream up some new challenges.
