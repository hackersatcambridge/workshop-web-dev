To do these workshops, you'll need a text editor and a modern web browser.

For a text editor, we recommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). You can install it from the website.

The latest version of Google Chrome, Safari, Edge or Firefox will work for a web browser, you are probably already using one of these.

In a hurry? You can create a website right in the browser. [Try JSBin](https://jsbin.com).
